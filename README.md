# Secret Friend

## Description

This project is a web application that allows users to enter friends' names into a list and then perform a random draw to determine who the "Secret Friend" is. The application is developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Add names**: Users can write a friend's name in a text field and add it to a visible list by clicking "Add".
- **Validate input**: If the text field is empty or the name is already in the list, the program will show an alert asking for a valid name.
- **View the list**: The entered names will appear in a list below the input field.
- **Random draw**: By clicking the "Draw Secret Friend" button, a name will be randomly selected from the list and displayed on the page.
